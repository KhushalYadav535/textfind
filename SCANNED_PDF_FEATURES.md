# Scanned PDF Processing Features

## Overview
The application now supports automatic processing of both scanned and text-based PDFs using advanced OCR technology.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic PDF Type Detection
- Automatically detects whether a PDF contains selectable text or is scanned
- Analyzes the first few pages to determine the PDF type
- Provides confidence scores for the analysis

### 2. Scanned PDF Processing
- Converts PDF pages to high-resolution images using PDF.js
- Processes images with Tesseract.js OCR engine
- Supports multiple languages including English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic
- Real-time progress tracking for large documents

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- Visual indicators showing PDF type (scanned vs text-based)
- Progress bars with detailed status updates
- Confidence scores for OCR results
- Page count and word count information

### 4. Multi-language Support
- Configurable language selection for OCR processing
- Support for mixed-language documents
- Optimized for common document languages

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `pdfjs-dist`: For PDF parsing and page rendering
- `tesseract.js`: For OCR processing (already included)

### New Files
- `src/utils/pdfProcessor.js`: Core PDF processing logic
- Enhanced `src/utils/pdfUtils.js`: Updated utilities with OCR support

### Enhanced Components
- `AdvancedUpload.jsx`: Now handles PDF analysis and OCR processing
- `FileUploadZone.jsx`: Shows PDF type detection results
- `PDFConversionHelper.jsx`: Updated to reflect new capabilities

## Usage

### For Users
1. Upload any PDF file (scanned or text-based)
2. The system automatically detects the PDF type
3. For scanned PDFs, OCR processing begins automatically
4. View progress and results with confidence scores
5. Download extracted text

### For Developers
```javascript
import { processPDFWithOCR, analyzePDF } from './utils/pdfUtils'

// Analyze PDF type
const analysis = await analyzePDF(pdfFile)

// Process PDF with OCR
const result = await processPDFWithOCR(pdfFile, {
  languages: ['eng', 'hin'],
  maxPages: 10,
  progressCallback: (progress) => {
    console.log(`Processing page ${progress.current}/${progress.total}`)
  }
})
```

## Performance Considerations

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: 50MB (increased from 10MB for scanned PDFs)
- Large files show warnings but are still processed
- Progress tracking helps users understand processing time

### Memory Management
- PDF pages are processed sequentially to avoid memory issues
- Canvas elements are properly cleaned up after use
- Configurable maximum page limits (default: 10 pages)

### Processing Time
- Text-based PDFs: Fast processing (seconds)
- Scanned PDFs: Slower processing (minutes for large files)
- Progress indicators keep users informed

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
- Corrupted PDF files: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- Unsupported languages: Falls back to English
- Memory limitations: Sequential processing with cleanup
- Network issues: Retry mechanisms for file uploads

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages for different failure types
- Suggestions for resolving common issues
- Fallback options for problematic files

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Batch processing for multiple PDFs
- Advanced preprocessing options (deskewing, noise reduction)
- Custom OCR model training
- Cloud-based processing for very large files
- Integration with document management systems

### Performance Optimizations
- Web Workers for background processing
- Caching of processed results
- Progressive loading for large documents
- Compression of intermediate images

## Testing

### Test Cases
- Various PDF types (scanned, text-based, mixed)
- Different languages and scripts
- Large files and multi-page documents
- Error conditions and edge cases

### Quality Assurance
- Confidence score validation
- Text accuracy testing
- Performance benchmarking
- User experience testing
