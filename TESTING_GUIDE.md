# PDF Processing Testing Guide

## üöÄ How to Test the Scanned PDF Processing

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The server should start on `http://localhost:5173`

### 2. Test Routes Available

#### Main Application Routes:
- **Home**: `http://localhost:5173/` - Landing page
- **Upload**: `http://localhost:5173/upload` - Main upload page with PDF support
- **Test Demo**: `http://localhost:5173/test` - Dedicated PDF testing page

### 3. Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Test PDF Processing (Main Upload Page)
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/upload`
2. Upload a PDF file
3. Watch the processing:
   - PDF analysis (scanned vs text-based detection)
   - Progress indicators
   - Results or fallback message

#### Scenario 2: Test PDF Processing (Test Demo Page)
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/test`
2. Upload a PDF file
3. See detailed analysis and processing results
4. Download results as text file

### 4. Expected Behavior

#### ‚úÖ Successful PDF Processing:
- Shows PDF type analysis (scanned/text-based)
- Displays progress indicators
- Extracts text with confidence scores
- Shows page count and word count

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è PDF Processing Fallback:
- Shows enhanced fallback interface
- Provides step-by-step conversion guide
- Links to online PDF converters
- Clear instructions for alternative methods

### 5. Test Files to Try

#### For Testing Fallback (Expected):
- Any PDF file (will likely trigger fallback due to worker issues)
- Large PDF files
- Password-protected PDFs

#### For Testing Success (If PDF.js works):
- Small, simple PDF files
- Text-based PDFs with selectable text

### 6. Features to Verify

- [ ] PDF file upload and validation
- [ ] Automatic PDF type detection
- [ ] Progress tracking during processing
- [ ] Fallback system when PDF.js fails
- [ ] Enhanced fallback UI with conversion tools
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Results display with confidence scores
- [ ] Download functionality

### 7. Browser Console

Check the browser console for:
- PDF.js worker loading messages
- Processing progress updates
- Error messages and fallback triggers
- OCR processing logs

### 8. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Try different PDF files
4. Check network connectivity for PDF.js worker

## üéØ Key Testing Points

1. **PDF Upload**: Should accept PDF files and show analysis
2. **Processing Flow**: Should show progress and handle errors gracefully
3. **Fallback System**: Should provide helpful alternatives when PDF processing fails
4. **User Experience**: Should be intuitive and provide clear guidance
5. **Error Handling**: Should not crash and should provide actionable solutions

## üì± Mobile Testing

Test on mobile devices to ensure:
- File upload works on mobile browsers
- UI is responsive and touch-friendly
- PDF processing works on mobile (may be slower)
